Computational_Physics-Eigenvalue
=========================================

This was an assignment in my Computational Physics class on understanding the use of Eigenvalues in
computational problems. I had originally started this project in C but was unable to get LAPACK to 
work correctly. So I redid this assignment in matlab.
